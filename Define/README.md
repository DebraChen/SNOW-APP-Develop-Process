I thought about making an app like an interactive book, containing their stories. 
As an art piece of the app, it is expressing:
1. Passing the feeling from interviewers,     
2. "Everyone is a professional decoder": https://restofworld.org/2022/china-social-media-censorship/   
3. The confusion when we see those "404", disappeared pages, and the fear of saying，or doing something wrong  
4. We locked our express desire until someone gave us the “right password”, then we will talk about certain things carefully
5. The dramatic stories of our society, and The style that we communicate in wechat: irony and symbolism
