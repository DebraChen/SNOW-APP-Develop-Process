This discover and research had been wrote very detaily, in order to recall and review some thoughts and ideas that I haven't dive too deepï¼Œ also works as mental cleansing. 


Stage 1:  
I thought abbout making a virtual space. It could have more artist's works (music, schulpture, architecture, fine arts etc) after they send to me, and I transfer them into digital works and put into unreal, make a cool event and gallery. I connected some artist, they are very happy to join, I tried to scan some works by Lidar, it was a bit rough cuz my Lidar is not precision enough.   
  
It was quit a lot of works, I'm not quit sure if I will got enough time to prepare it well mad make it done before the final, so I also prapared to do some personal music programs by using OpenFramework, Touch Designer(make visual) Arena(Basic VJ software), Leapmotion(Gesture Control), and some physical interaction etc.

During the first meeting, Rebecca gave me lots of important suggestion about music programs, also about softwares that could be useful, we agreed that I will make music project at that time. I list them here as notes for future works.

At this period of time, musicians and I had several gigs together. I was satisfied to use stylegan2, LucidSonic Dreams, DiscoDifussion to make the video clips that lots of people likes. But in the process, I also made lots of terrible and ugly videos(there are so many different reasons, like the dataset are too complex, too many colors, or runtime not enough, or doesn't gave right describtion when I use the difussion etc).   
Look at those images and videos, I start thinking why generally we all like beautiful things, but lake of appreciation of ugliness, I researched some of the artists and works(Clare Shenstone, Damien Hirst, Gerard Garouste, Gunther von Hagens etc), I felt uncomfortable, alert, confused. They feeling makes me remembered the life back in China. And the second day, I saw the news about about lock down has been continued in Xinjiang for 32 days, etc(Will shown in my research news file). I felt the pain in my heart and mission on my shouder. Instead of so something for entertament, I wish to see what could I do for those who stffered or are suffering.  
  
I was thinging about making something to fool government testing or a secret language to communicate with other people, so I had an interview with some people who live in Xinjiang, they prefer speak the stories out secretly.

Then I started further research and hands on practices
