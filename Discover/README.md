This discovery and research had been written in very detailed, to recall and review some thoughts and ideas that I haven't dived too deep into， which also works as mental cleansing. 


Stage 1:  
I thought about making a virtual space. It could have more artists’ works (music, sculpture, architecture, fine arts etc) after they send them to me, and I transfer them into digital works and put them into unreal, making a cool event and gallery. I connected with some artists, and they are very happy to join, I tried to scan some works by Lidar, but it was a bit rough cuz my Lidar is not precise enough.   
  
It was quite a lot of work, and I'm not quite sure if I will got enough time to prepare it well mad to make it done before the final, so I also prepared to do some personal music programs by using OpenFramework, Touch Designer(make visual) Arena(Basic VJ software), Leapmotion(Gesture Control), and some physical interaction etc.

During the first meeting, Rebecca gave me lots of important suggestions about music programs, and also about software that could be useful, we agreed that I will make music project at that time. I list them here as notes for future work.

During this period, musicians and I had several gigs together. I was satisfied to use StyleGan2, LucidSonic Dreams, and DiscoDifussion to make the video clips that lots of people like. But in the process, I also made lots of terrible and ugly videos(there are so many different reasons like the dataset is too complex, too many colours or runtime is not enough or doesn't give the right description when I use the diffusion etc).   
Looking at those images and videos, I start thinking why generally we all like beautiful things, but lake of appreciation for ugliness, I researched some of the artists and works(Clare Shenstone, Damien Hirst, Gerard Garouste, Gunther von Hagens etc), I felt uncomfortable, alert, confused. The feeling makes me remember life back in China. And the second day, I saw the news about the lockdown continuing in Xinjiang for 32 days, etc(Will be shown in my research news file). I felt the pain in my heart and the mission on my shoulder. Instead of so something for entertainment, I wish to see what could I do for those who suffered or are suffering.

I was thinking about making something to fool government testing or a secret language to communicate with other people, but I wonder if there are any safety problems for me if someone is gonna use it in unexpected ways, so I had an interview with some people who live in Xinjiang, they prefer to speak the stories out secretly. Also, according to my research, those companies or person who tried to make VPN was in trouble, and there some code transfer software already exist, I also wrote a very simple code creat and transferring app before, (https://github.com/DebraChen/Python-Projects/tree/main/03%20-%20python%20coding%20game ) so I decided to make something to tell their stories instead.

Then I started further research and hands-on practices
