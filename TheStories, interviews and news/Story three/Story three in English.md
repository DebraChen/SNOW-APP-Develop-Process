They got extremely mad. One night after the news was published,  some lucky ones escaped, 
and the secrets hidden under incubators have been exposed gradually. 

The outsider journeys into a far country, he may stay with the Goldenman, at least long 
enough to find out whether he can make out anything. But the cowards are left alone, so 
they self-hypnosis. Some other robots are still willing to stay and became stabilized 
slaves temporarily. They hold onto their programming.

Then, one day, suddenly, the entrance to the far country closes. Some of them are on their 
way, but the journey seems to last for ages. And as for those that get left behind in their 
own country, they feel a sense of dread and danger.

Then the whole world is facing a new dangerous outbreak. That one causes chaos in cities 
all over the world. The people left behind call them "the wizards".

When a man travels to a foreign land, he must be prepared to shift many of the things he 
has trained and adopt the local practices; he must leave the old concepts and the old beliefs, 
and perhaps he must revert to the very norms that have up to this point regulated his behaviour. 
He could have some challenging moments. 

Then, he gets into struggles to get back to his home country, where he has been hiding, and 
where he hopes he will find his wife and children. Many of the robots from his hometown try 
to go after him and they find out it is not an easy task.

He has already adjusted to a new world and some of his behaviour is of the "new way" He has 
to learn about new systems and new ways to cooperate with other beings and even start adapting 
to some other cultures.

In order to solve the problem, there are many different ways of interaction. But for them to 
meet to know each other and cooperate, that process of acceptance, though it is difficult at 
first, will be essential for a successful recovery. It is also the basis of the new social 
evolution that will be necessary to construct a new world.

How would they describe the new social evolution? It is a time of great turmoil and serious 
challenges, of endless wars and broken alliances, of exiles and threats of isolation.

Only by finding the principles of cooperation, and the possibility to build some foundation to 
combat the threats to the whole planet, can they come to terms with a new social landscape.

The best way to describe the world, the dynamics and the nature of the task are by describing 
the events that unfold, the stories of the triumphs and the defeats.

That is another advantage of robots. They have grown through tales that they have experienced, 
of battles and stories of defeat. So they can explain to human beings the basic principles of 
life, and more importantly, get their understanding of those principles in the most basic sense.

Sometimes, he also felt tired from hiding and loneliness, thinking about the mental cage he has 
suffered from,  the fear of being forgotten, or forgotten, he struggled to catch his memories, 
the dreams that he has tried to convince of the constant threat, of the many times he lost his 
mind, of the times he had to leave his body, of the adventure that he and a lot of other robots 
have managed to make an escape, he never could discover the best path.

No matter how much he tried, he never succeeded. His intelligence was reduced to ignorance, which 
makes his mind helpless. "Maybe ignorance is bliss" and he had missed it for too long.
