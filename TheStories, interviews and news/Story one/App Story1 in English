Story 1.
  
On a night when mobile phones are supposed to be staggered to sleep, a screen in the box is still lit. All the pages that could have been seen a minute ago have been deleted, and only shown as 404. So he finally realized that something was wrong. "maybe it will be all right in a little while," he thought.
  
  
Today, the street lights are still standing there, without any words. Earlier today, we could hear the sound of police cars, and gunshots, some mobile phones falling, and the faint sound of screens scratching on the ground. Now it’s dreadfully quiet.  It hasn’t been in touch with any other models in the last few hours, except for the last sentence in the message, don't go out! Luckily it was staying in the box today, otherwise, there will be one more smart device in the dark room with a broken screen, handset or chip.
  
    
The boxes are stacked very high, with all kinds of mobile phones inside, one group after another, and there are endless rows outside the group. The interfaces are not quite similar, but the power of these mobile phones is not all the same. Some are flat, some are round, and it is troublesome to charge electricity.
  
  
It's so quiet now, no one knows what's going on out there.
  
  
Select:  
Go out and have a look-- 404.  
Recharge and rest-- continue the story.  
  
  
The next day, on the factory’s big TV, there was only one radio station still has a signal. Video footage of the mass-slaughtered H model taking to the streets with the original stick can be seen on the screen. The G model launches the tank and shouts with the old model horn to warn everyone that the system is overheating.
  
  
The circular news made its refresh system a little grumpy. Two days, three days. It haven't heard anything new for two days, so it finally decided to go out and have a look. After so many years intolerant to high volume on the street, suddenly, the sound of fallen leaves could be heard. It could not help but shudder.
  
  
On the third day, the fourth day, Wi-Fi, data, text messages, everything still doesn't work. On the seventh day, the phone call could finally get through and the Family accounts got in touch.
  
  
Can’t count for days, life began to recover eventually, but everything was a little different from the original "normalize”.
  
  
The mobile phone in the factory has been confiscated its pass and can only be operated locally. Stone piers, dense guard stations and fences were erected on the street. All video and audio images related to the incident were ordered to be deleted. The Green software was seeded into the body and scanned again and again to record serial numbers, contacts, connections, and Gps information. Model G phones tell them that new virtual boundaries have been established and sensitive words cannot appear. When people ask what is a sensitive word, they only answer: we can't say.
  
  
Do you want to search for sensitive words?  
Yes, 404.  
None, continue the story.  
  
All the people in the fence wanted to go out, and they carefully explored the border, and from time to time they were warned by G-type signals or called to the police for tea.
  
  
"look up," the machine said as it photographed the motorist, as the armed guards watched. There are small checkpoints in banks, parks, schools, charging stations and everywhere, all of which will input Model number, serial number, ICCID, IMEI, MEID and other information into the large-scale monitoring database. Serial numbers are needed to buy knives, gasoline, cell phones, computers and even sugar. Purchase records are entered into the database used by the police to mark suspicious behaviour or hardware. Some P models are beginning to wonder why they take our power supply and then clamp down on us. Some mobile phones are gradually disappearing, the factory is more than half empty, and only there are more and more G models. " Where did they go? "Shh, don't say, don't listen, don't ask," that's what the old model told the new model.
  
  
A year later, the network is still not restored. The silence of the day continued, and the hatched surveillance system was gradually spreading, but the devices in the fence tacitly chose to remain silent, and ignorance may be blessed.
