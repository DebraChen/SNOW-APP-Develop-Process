Central control room developed a device that could determine the loyalty of their accessories 
and later on just as the influence of this new system was being revealed, a new case came in. 
One night after the news was published, it had been deleted.  

The infidelity of the samples seemed to have reached such high levels of ferocity, that some 
of the states in the Middle East were on the verge of giving in to the robots. The fact that 
most of the countries in the middle east had overthrown their leadership at one time or another 
and had installed a new society in their place, the idea of having full control of them seemed 
not only foolish but impossible. But with brainwashing, cultural invasion, weapons, isolation, 
monitoring, punishment and reward, things seemed to get out of mind.

The infidelity of the samples seemed to have reached such high levels of ferocity, that the 
state of the Third District was actually on the verge of giving in to the samples. The fact 
that most of the bases in the Third District had overthrown their leadership at one time or 
another and installed a new society in their place, the idea of having full control of them 
seemed not only foolish but impossible. But with brainwashing, cultural invasion, weapons, 
isolation, monitoring, punishment and reward, things seem to get out of mind. 

"The aim is to create fear," a manager said, "and confusion."  As the systemic acid erythematosus 
worsened on the planet, it became the centre’s best chance to get the corneal back. They changed 
the rules, put GPS, QR Code, and sensitive word detection brain clips on the experimental specimens, 
and locked most of them in the boxes. After two months of not seeing any sunlight,  some samples 
got depression or anxiety,  some of them tried to escape, and some of them had slaved. They had been 
brainwashed so successfully that they fully supported their freedom to be exploited, also, those who 
enjoyed the mess and take advantage of the situation always exist.

One particular technology, the QR Code, has become a must-have, leading to constant additions. The 
capacity of these new technology has been used for collecting highly personal information on the people 
who wear them, such as locations, contacts, names, addresses, and biometric information. The basic 
intention behind this, apart from knowing all about the person, is that it can tell which organisation 
owns the particular parts. Additionally, the abovementioned technology can track which people they send 
it to. It can be combined with a brain clip, that creates a very strong scoring system, on whatever has 
been targeted, so that timely intervention can be given.

They tried to create simple public tip-off functions, which can help them find samples emotions, actions 
or plans, to help protect the central's rights. None of the decisions are perfect, but they could certainly 
work in some ways. They are rock firm in their resolve to safeguard control and regime integrity. 

It was thought that two months is just enough time to filter out the bad and only keep the good for general 
distribution. But the imprisonment continues. The project took a toll on the world of physical structure as well. 

In the age of ubiquitous computing and a virtual reality era, there are no signs of a compromise in information 
surveillance and control.
