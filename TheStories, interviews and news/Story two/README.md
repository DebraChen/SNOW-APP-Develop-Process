In this chapter, I used AI to write a story with me. I gave a beginning sentence: "Central control room developed a device  
that could determine the loyalty of their robots and later on just as the influence of this new system was being revealed,  
a new case came in."  
  
Then generated some sentences, changed the storyline according to realities, and changed the sensitive words, and also changed the 
main charactersâ€™ descriptions to be more fictional. And repeat the process.  
  
Some results brought me more inspiration, some results lead to an unexpected story,  for example,

So I change it back to my storyline, according to the research I did.
