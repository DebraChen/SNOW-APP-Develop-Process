In this chapter, the story describing the ways that the power controlls the personal freedom.

I used TalktoTransformer (InferKit Demo) to write a story with me. I gave a beginning sentence: "Central control room developed a device  
that could determine the loyalty of their robots and later on just as the influence of this new system was being revealed,  
a new case came in."  
  
Then generated some sentences, changed the storyline according to realities, and changed the sensitive words, and also changed the 
main charactersâ€™ descriptions to be more fictional. And repeat the process.  
  
Some results brought me more inspiration, some results lead to an unexpected story,  for example,

So I change it back to my storyline, which had been planed according to the research that I did.

I don't have any control of how I expected tory going excpt the text that I entered before I press the blue button, who is the decency or villain, so I feel the advantage is it helps with brain storming and words boost. So I feel like I am still taking the Initiative, and write the story that I want, but AI helped me to cut half the time in finding inspirations.
