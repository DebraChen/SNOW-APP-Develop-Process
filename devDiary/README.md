After 4 weeks of swift basic knowledge learning, I started the first version on 19 October 2022 at 13:12, which get a bit too complex by following different tutorial resources, after 4 versions of messy projects, the developing plan has been broken into smaller pieces. Instead of following all the processes, searching the specific functions to write makes developing much easier. it's the sifting from the learning model to the practice model. (Learning notes saved at Notability, Swift, UAL. Still renewing, not uploaded yet 28/10/2022 )
  

There are the reseources that I used in the process

## Learning Process 
I learned the fundamentals and the exploration at Joel's Dip-apple class and started understanding and explaining the swift.

And I made my first photo frame app, it's so fun to use, so I chose to abandon my old way: installations, physical computing, or game engine, then turn to learn and use swift to write an artwork

(My first app, has only one page, but led me to step on the first stage of apple development)   

To add and link the second page, I followed several tutorials online and found the simplest way to make it works: https://github.com/DebraChen/SNOW-APP-Develop-Process/tree/main/devDiary/step01%20choice3%20NoCodeStoryboard  
  
It took me a while to understand how to add and use the view controller, also the differences between the tab bar controller and the navigation controller. And other important parts.  
### View controller   
The place where we put UILabels, UIWebViews and UIImageView etc, consists of one basic view（app page）.  
### Tab bar controller   
Tab bar controller controlling maximum 5 view controllers. Also providing a root menu for different distinct data sets, It’s what allows the user to jump between these views.   
### Navigation controller. 
The typical character for a Navigation Controller is a Table View with a Segue. The data between the Views are taken care of by a custom view controller class. This class is where the properties with outlets are stored that connect to their respective UILabels, UIWebViews and UIImageViews.   
  
## Related words  
### Segue
The Segue is what manages the transitions between a target action from a View Controller to another view.  

The ways to name, link, change links of UI kits, and call segue brought me a lot of problems, especially when I try to add more than one view controller, I need to write some more classes and functions, to switch pages and to add more details, but luckily every problem has been offered ways to solve online or similar to C++.  
  
I wrote some more problems and ways of writing them in those devDiary files, I think the most challenge is that I need to have the confidence to decide to write an app by using swift. Mainly because it's a new language, none of my friends writes coding in this language so when I meet problems I need to have the ambition to solve all of them by myself, in a limited time.

It took me around 40 days to write the code as a beginner, but now the whole process worked well as my plan, so I felt very happy about my decision. Even if it is so rough and I don't have time to make any visual design yet, now I have more confidence to face some more challenges.
  
Appreciate a lot for the support that I got from Rebeca and Joel for the project, and also the self-learning ability from CCI
