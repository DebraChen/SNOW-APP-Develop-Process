After 4 weeks of swift basic knowledge learning, I started the first version on 19 October 2022 at 13:12, which get a bit too complex by following different tutorial resources, after 4 versions of messy projects, the developing plan has been broken into smaller pieces. Instead of following all the processes, searching the specific functions to write makes developing much easier. it's the sifting from the learning model to the practice model. (Learning notes saved at Notability, Swift, UAL. Still renewing, not uploaded yet 28/10/2022 )
  

There are the reseources that I used in the process
