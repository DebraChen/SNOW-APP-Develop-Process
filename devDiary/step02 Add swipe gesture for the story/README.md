To show the story with text and images, I considered several ways.  
I researched different reading apps, for example, Books, Wechat Reading, Times, Kindle, ReadingList, Safari, etc. I realize there are two main user habits, scrolling down and scrolling left.  
To test user habits, I made an app with only one frozen page with texts and another app with images. 70% of them chose to scroll up when they try to read more.

So I decided to make the first version's view control as scroll up and down 
  
1. Open Main.storyboard and drag a Scroll view, and put Image View inside Scroll View.
