Challenging and rewarding
It took me around 40 days to write the swift code as a beginner, and I don't know who 
could I talk about detailed problems that I met to sak for help. So I will remember 
those days that I locked myself in the little room and get through despair from all
of the coding and writing chanllenges. It's brings me more confidence even it is not 
perfectly good, but I could finally overcome my perfectionism and say "I have tried my best".

The coding part is not the biggest challenge. The hardest part is to face the scars of my heart, 
try to fight it, deny it and try conciliation. Fight with fear, and try to be more brave.
Try to talking with those who are suffering, empathy their fear, anger, painful and don't
be beaten by those strong feeling. I want to thanks to my parents, my friends Miya and Mattew 
for stand by me when I go through all of them, and give me support. Even when it might be 
dangerous for them to help with the interviews.

rethink
I think I should record the user testing videos next time, they suggested me lots of 
usrful suggestions on round two, but I could not remember all of them, it's very sad. 
So I will make better user test summary during the exhibition, do it more professionally.
  
I also need to considering how to collect, analyse and display interviews, and research better,  
to put them in order and be more convenient to use
