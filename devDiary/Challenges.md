Challenging and rewarding
It took me around 40 days to write the swift code as a beginner, and I don't know who 
could I talk about detailed problems that I met to sak for help. So I will remember 
those days that I locked myself in the little room and get through despair from all
of the coding and writing chanllenges. It's brings me more confidence even it is not 
perfectly good, but I could finally overcome my perfectionism and say "I have tried my best".

The coding part is not the biggest challenge. The hardest part is to face the scars of my heart, 
try to fight it, deny it and try conciliation. Fight with fear, and try to be more brave.
Try to talking with those who are suffering, empathy their fear, anger, painful and don't
be beaten by those strong feeling. I want to thanks to my parents, my friends Miya and Mattew 
for stand by me when I go through all of them, and give me support. Even when it might be 
dangerous for them to help with the interviews.

rethink
I think I should record the user testing videos next time, they suggested me lots of 
usrful suggestions on round two, but I could not remember all of them, it's very sad. 
So I will make better user test summary during the exhibition, do it more professionally.
  
I also need to considering how to collect, analyse and display interviews, and research better,  
to put them in order and be more convenient to use. (by chart, exel, fiel or better ways)

After the second round user test at 24/11/2022, two of audience mentioned that they didn't totally 
understand the stories, because they are not native english speaker, but they could feel the fear 
from some keywords. I realized I didn't consider too much about what language I'm going to chose 
because I study in UK using english. To be more friendly to people from multy culture background, 
I should  consider the accessibility start with thinking how to break the language barriers. 

So I did some research, then I found the art book project that made by XuBing called “Dishu”.  
Anyone participating in current life, regardless of cultural background, may read it. In other 
words, as a natural person conversant with current life, one may grasp the tale without translate.

So for further work, I will research some more samples and try to find common laguages.
