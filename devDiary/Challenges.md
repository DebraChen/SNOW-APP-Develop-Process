I learned the fundamentals and the exploration at Joel's Dip-apple class, started understanding and explording the swift.

And I made my first photo frame app, it's so fun to use, so I chosed to abandon my old way: installations, then turn to learn and use swift to write an artwork

(My first app, it has only has one page, but leds me to step on the first stage of apple developing)   

In order to add and link the second page, I folloed several tutorials online, and found the simplest way to make it works: https://github.com/DebraChen/SNOW-APP-Develop-Process/tree/main/devDiary/step01%20choice3%20NoCodeStoryboard  
  
It took me a while to understand how to add and use view controller, also the differences between tab bar controller and navigation controller. And other important parts.  
### View controller   
The place where we put UILabels, UIWebViews and UIImageView etc, they consist one basic view（app page）.  
### Tab bar controller   
Tab bar controller controling maximun 5 view controllers. Also providing a root menu to different distinct data sets, It’s what allows the user to jump between these views.   
### Navigation controller. 
The typical characters for a Navigation Controller is a Table View with a Segue. The data between the Views is taken care of by a custom view controller class. This class is where the properties with outlets are stored that connect to their respective UILabels, UIWebViews and UIImageView’s.   
  
### Segue
The Seque is what manages the transitions between a target action from a View Controller to another view.  

The ways to name, link, change links of UIkits, call segue brought me lot of problems, expecially when I try to add more than one view controllers, I need to write some more class and functions, to switch pages and to add more detaild, but luckily every problems has been offered ways to solve online or similar to C++.  
  
I wrote ome more problems and ways of writing them in those devDiary files, I think the most challenge is that I need to have confidence to decide writing an app by using swift. Mainly because it's a new language, none of my friends write coding in this language so when I meet problems I need to have ambition to solve all of them by my myself, in limited time.

It took me around 40 days to write the code as a beginner, now the whole process worked very well as my fist plan, so I felt very happy about my decision, now I have some more confidence to facing some more challenges.
