Challenges and 
It took me around 40 days to write the swift code as a beginner, and I don't know who 
could I talk about detailed problems that I met to sak for help. So I will remember 
those days that I locked myself in the little room and get through despair from all
of the coding and writing chanllenges. It's brings me more confidence even it is not 
perfectly good, but I could finally overcome my perfectionism and say "I have tried my best".

The coding part is not the biggest challenge, as well as the feeling of fear, anger, painful
that I get from the 

rethink

I think I should record the user testing videos next time, they suggested me lots of 
usrful suggestions on round two, but I could not remember all of them, it's very sad. 
So I will make better user test summary during the exhibition, do it more professional
