Test and interview summary  
I haven’t got much experience in test projects with users and doing interviews, but I found those things are very important and interesting during the process, so I will take studies on it.  
1. I should record the user testing videos when doing user testing next time. Volunteers talked about their stories and suggested useful ideas in round two, but sadly I could not remember all of them. So I will make better user test records and summaries during the upcoming final exhibition more professionally. As well as a documentary record of the creative process for further works.  
   
2. After research and tests I should figure out how to collect, analyse and display interviews, and research better. Considering the ways to put them in order and more convenient to use. (by charts, excels, files or other better ways)  
  
Language Boundaries  
After the second round of user tests on 24/11/2022, two of the audience mentioned that they didn't totally understand the stories, because they are not native English speakers, but they could feel the fear from some keywords. I realized I didn't consider too much about what language I'm going to choose because I study in the UK using English. To be more friendly to people from multicultural backgrounds, I should consider accessibility starting with thinking about how to break the language barriers.   
After getting the feedback, I did some research, and then I found the art book project made by XuBing called “Book from the ground”(Dishu).  It’s the book that anyone participating in current life, regardless of cultural background, may read it. As a natural person conversant with current life, one may grasp the tale without translation.【http://www.xubing.com/en/search/?key=book】  
So for further work, I will research some more samples and try to find common languages. Make iterative art pieces.  
  
Challenges  
Overcome perfectionism and self-doubting  
It took me around 40 days to write the swift code as a beginner, and I don't know who could I talk about detailed problems that I met to ask for help. So I will remember those days when I locked myself in the little room and get through despair from all of the coding and writing challenges. As the current version has been finished, I have more confidence even it is not perfectly good. I could finally overcome my unsure, doubt, fear of the unknown, and perfectionism then say "I have tried my best”.  
  
Take an Academic Perspective  
The coding part is not the biggest challenge. The hardest part is to face the scars on my heart from things that I suffered and my family and friends are suffering. I went through denying it, fighting with fear, and then trying to conciliate with myself. try to be braver. Try to talk with those who are suffering, empathy their fear, and anger and not be beaten by those strong feelings.   
Also, It's really hard to find interviewers who would like to take the risks and talk about things online. I appreciate even when it might be dangerous for them, they still chose to speak things out. I only used very few parts that related to the topic, it will take me some more time to summarise them because it is mentally torturing, and very painful to look at those real tragedies.
