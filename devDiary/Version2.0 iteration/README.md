A trick  

Through user testing, I found that if I set the back button in the story page invisible, users will get lost when they get into 404 views,   
so I start thinking about what do I want to test or express.

I remembered last time when we had the exhibition when players met and then challenge, they often just chose to leave.    
So it has become a dilemma for me. I want to bring them confusion, the feeling, but I also want to let them enjoy the story. So I need to   
Choose which is the main character on my stage. As my material is the app instead of a paper book, I decided to let players meet the feeling when    
they chose the "wrong" button, which lead to a "404" page. 

So I could test their reactions. They might be able to find the hidden "back" button, or quit the page, and have to decode, enter the right  
code again, or will they just go to the second story?  The troublesome decoding process might let them to think what is the "right" anwser,  
and, wait, who decided the "right" and "wrong"?  
  
Also, get their feedback about how they feel about the missing page. the story? the decoding?  
  
I think I could get some fun interviews after the testing. Could be a fun human observation.
